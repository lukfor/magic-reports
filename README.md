# Magic-Reports ðŸª„

Reporting and data visualization is key in data science. Magic-Reports is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) designed to simplify the creation of HTML reports with rich visualizations and structured content. The DSL allows users to define data, plots, and other report elements in a simple and modular way.

- **Simplified Syntax:** Intuitive constructs for HTML elements to reduce verbosity.<br/>
-  **Data Binding:** Easily incorporate dynamic data into your reports.<br/>
-  **Conditional Rendering:** Streamlined syntax for conditional content.<br/>
-  **Loops:** Simplified iteration for repetitive elements.<br/>
-  **Integrated Visualizations:** Out of the Box support for datatables, bootstrap and plotly.<br/>
-  **No JavaScript Required:** Create powerful reports without the need for JavaScript knowledge.<br/>
-  **Components:** Define reusable components to enhance code organization.<br/>
-  **Custom Styling:** Apply custom styles to elements easily for a personalized look.
